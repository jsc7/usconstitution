Mobile friendly U.S. Constitution

This is a sample mobile app that I built on top of Framework7 providing the U.S. Constitution.

To view, clone/download and open index.html. 

If you are using Safari, you will need to select the "Disable Local File Restrictions" option in the Developer tab for the app to work.  This may also apply to other browsers.
